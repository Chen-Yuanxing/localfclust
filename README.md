# localfclust

The package **localfclust** implements the local functional clustering (LFC) method proposed by Chen et al. (2024). LFC aims to identify both the global clustering structure and multiple different local clustering structures.
The method relies on the locally group-wise fusion and B-spline approximation.

In addition to the developed package, we also provide some files to reproduce the simulation results and analysis results of COVID-19 data.
